DESCRIPTION oF THE HEART,

VESSELS AND C1RCULAT10N 'OF THE BLOOD

IN FlsHES,

CHAPTER I.
ι. In all the Vfishes. 1 have disses-sled, there is hutone hears,

consisting osone auricle and one ventricle‚ and, from the
latter, one artery is sent out, which is en tirely spent on the
gills. From the gssls, therefore the returning blood passes'to
all the other- parts os the body, without the interventiou of a
second beart, as in man (a).

2. So far is generally known! but the whole course of
the blood has not been traced xwitl1fi2fficientaceuraey3 so that
several curious and integresling circumstances have escaped
uotlce.

3.I

(a) To be more readily understood, Ι shall generally apply the
terms fore, back, upper, under, inm-r, omer, in the same
manner as is done in speaking of the human body: or I shall
suppose the fish to be placed ere& with its head uppermost.
But in describing the ear and other parts, ofthe head itself‚
Ι shall suppose the fish in its natural situation, as the hrain
and organs of the senses have not the same direftion as in man,
with respe& to the trunk of the body,

1f lungS‚ as well as gills, are found in the Petromyzon
and Diodon of Linmeus, itis probable there may be two ven·
tricles in their bearn

, In the Sepia ‚ which has been generally confidered as a fish,

>‘but which is with more propriety reckoned, a worm by Lin„
naeus, Ihave, many years ago, discovered three hear-ts.

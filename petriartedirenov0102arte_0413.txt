OF THffHEARE vEssELs Α CIRCUL. ecc. γιχ 85⁶

3'0 1 shall therefore g1ve a particular description of the
‘circulating vessels-‚of the (kare, with which 1 have found the
»pisces of Liitnaeus agree in every material circumstanti& and
Ἰ shall begin with the branchial artery‚

See'i. Ῑ.

, 4. At the beginning of the branchial artery there are three
semilzmar valves (b), the middle parts of which analogous to
*the Corpuscula Morgagni, are much thicker than in man, and
illustrate the use of these organs in him , as they very evident-
ly assist in preventing the return os the blood When the arte-
ty is in helion. Between these valves· and the principal cavity
of the ventricle in the skate, there is a cylindrical cana! interpo-
sed (c), the coats of which have the same musculas texture as
the ventriclc itself 3· and their contrafflon co·operating Withthat
of the ventricle‚ we are thence led, more &vidently than in

’ , man, to perceive the analogy between the structure of the arte-

ἰτῖες, and that of the beart.

5. The coronary arteries of the beart do not take their
rise from the branchia! artery, which like the pulmonary iu
inan, is spent entirely on their lungs or gills, by five pairs of
great branches in the skate, and by four in the pisces of Lin-
naeus (d).

6. When We take a superficial view of the small bnlk of
the gills; when We refleci, that an organ sor restoring mo-
mentum to the blood fimilar to the left ventricle of our heart,
is wanting in fishes; aud When further We consider the extra-
ordinary lize of the red particles of their blood3 We might be
tempted‚ at first light, to suppose, that their branchial arte-4
ry dit not diyide into very minute brancheS, or that it resem-

186 OF THE HEART, VESSELS

bled the rete mirabile? of the carotid arrery of the herbivomus
> uadruped. But a nearer vieW will undeceive us. For Ι have
ἓοιιιιά, that, by elegant subdivismnS and folds of the mem-
brane of the· gills‚ their surface, in a large skate‚ is nearly
η equal to the whole externa] sursace of the human body.

7. Thus in each fide of the body of a ssxate there are four
double gills, or gills with two fides each, and one smgle gill3
, or there are in all eighteen fides ‘or filrfaceS‚ on Which the
branchial artery is spread out. On each of these fides there are
about 50 divissons‚ or doublings of the membrane of the
gills (e). Each divifion has ou each fide of it 160 subdivi-
fior13, doublings‚ or folds of its membrane3 the length of
each of which in a very large sszate is about one-eighth osan
ineh ‚ and its breadth about one-fixteenth of an inch (f). So
that in the whole gills there are 144‚000 fi1bdivifions, or folda,
the two fides o? each of which are equal to the 64th part of a
square meh, or the furface of the whole gills in a large skate
· is equal to 2250 square incheS, that is, to more than 1 5 squa-
re feet, Which have been supposed equal to the whole ex-
ternal surfaee of the human body. When after a good iaie&-
ion of the artery‚ a microscope is applied, the whole extent
of the membrane of the gills is seen covered with a beautiful
net-work of exceedingly minute veffeIS. ³

3. As fishes taint the water they respire, in nearly the
same manner as We taint the air We breathe‚ it appears that
some matter, either useless or hurtful, or both, is carried off
from their blood as it paffes through their gius.

9. When dillilled oil of turpentine, coloured With
vermffion, is injedled With moderate force into the branch-
ial artery of a living or recently dead skate, some of the co-

Iourless part of the oil exsudes upon the surface oi the gssls,

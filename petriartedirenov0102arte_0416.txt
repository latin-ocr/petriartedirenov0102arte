17. From the uppermost vein D. E. of.the second gill·
other small arteries F, F. are sent off to the jast'. After that‘
a vein K is added, compoledoftheunder vein H. ofthe second
· gill and upper 'one 1 of the third. A little below the joining,

'of all these veins a retrograde army L, analogous to our verb:

” - tebral, is sent off to the braia, cerebellum a'nd top ofthe spi-

nal marrow, the branches of which have large and nume-³·

rous communications With each other and Withhthe correspon-
ding artery ‘of the other fide3 and from them chiefly the en-'
cephalon is supplied. Then the trunk M, from which this
artery came off, meets at N With its felIoW M from the other
fide3 and, about a finger-breadth lower, there is added, on
each fide , a vein R, formed hythe under vein P oi the third
gill, andupper vein Qof the fourth.

ι 8. About a quarter of an inch belo-w the meeting ofall
&he above at T, is sent offfrom each fide, at nearly right an-
gle8‚ a very large artery U, ‘analogous in same measure to out
subclavian. A large branch‚ a, from the root ,of that artery,
supplies some parts ol the lower imvm then running towards
the fore-part of the gius, it anastomofes freely With the exterior
ends of all the branchia} veins (i), after which it sends bran·-
ehes QQ cho te gills themselves , which seem to me ana·
{logous to our branchial arterie33 especially as from the fame
part the beart receives its coronaris arterias (k). The rest of
the great artery, Which 1 have called like to our subclavian,

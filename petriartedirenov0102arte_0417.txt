ΛΝΒ CIRCULATION IN FisHEs περ

Γιρρῐίεε the numerous and large muscles and fins on the fide
of the fis h as fn dow 11 as the fins near to the anus.

19. At last to the trunk T before mentioned, is added
a large vein X, on each fide, Which conveys the blood from
the undet· vein S of the fourth gill, and both veius V. W. of
the fifth gil! (l); and we are led by it to a great vessel Y, which
now affl? mes plainly the office of an artery resembling our
aorta deflendam.

χ 20 From the fore· part of this trunk two large Branches
e d. analogous to om· caeliae and messntew'c arteaies, are sent
offto the cliylopoietic viscer23 a fiuall bianch fiom Which en-
ters the livet, resembling our hepatic arm y (m). ’

2 1. From the fides of the aorta the organs ofgeneration
and urine are supplied by small arteries e. e e. e. etc. and from
the lower part os the trunk are sent oftwo latet-al branchesf'.
f. , that may be 'compared to our iliae cm temes, and which sup·
ply the muscles and fins at the lower part ofthe body.

22. A middle artery g runs straight down into the taik
{offered and protested by cartilage and terminares the aortie

K, 2.3 From the remarkable course of the arteries of the
beart and of the branchial and hepatic arterieS, fimilar to that
in man, We fee clear proof, that the blood, which, aster pas·
fing through the gills‚ has undergone one circulation, or ra-
ther here has passed through one artety and one vein, is unfit
for some office or office-s, which are performed hythe blood
in the heart, gills and Ιίνέι·

24 Nutrition only has been mentioned by authorsg but
no full ly fatisfying reason has as yet been· given why by one ³
circiilation the blood should become unfit for this purpose ἆ

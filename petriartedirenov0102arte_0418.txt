’ 25, From the extremities of these several arteries the
blood is returned to the heart by veins Which in‘ general re-
semble our vena portarum (n) and venae cavae (o).

26. When We examine these veins more accurately, We
find two venae cavae, a right and left one, equal in fize and
fimilat· in situation, communicating freely by their trunks in '
the abdomen, and in other places, as in the heart, by their
branches, In both, the branches are much larges in their
course than at their terminations and they, belides, form con-
fiderable receptacles of blood. For instance, each of the ab·
dominal cavae has double the diameter of the cavae conjoined
at the head3 and, under the place at which the two cavae com-
municate, there is a large receptacle of blood covered hythe
ovarium in the female, and by the testes in the male (p). In
like manner, the hepatie veins between the livet and dia·-
phragm form finuses, the diameter of Which Vis ten times great-
er than that, of their openings into the cavae (q),

The veins from the tail, joining with the iliae vein, form the

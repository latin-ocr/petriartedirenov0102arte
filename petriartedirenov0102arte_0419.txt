'AND CIRCULATION' IN FISHEffl 1921

inuscles of the back and lateral parts form ‘a trunk resembling
our right subclavimz veim to which the imernaljngztlar 33,
and extewzal jugulam* 34 are soon added. A little farther in,
the right vena cava lcepotica 31, terminates3 and¹ this, at 32,
is joined to the left vena cava hepatica. The communicating
canal also reeeives the blood from a middle lobe of the liver3
that organ being divided into threesslobeS. The two cavae 35,
at last meet3 and after receiving the coronary veins 37 of the
beart, discharge themselves through a round hole with rifing
edges into the back part of the auriele of the beart.

28. Within the externa] jugulat veins‚ and at the termi-
nation of the internal jugulare, I observe a pair osvalves‚ like
to those in the veins of the human fianec‘l. At the termina·
tion of the renal veine and large branches of the hepatia: veins
we find fingle membranes fixed by threads from their edge3‚
resembling the valve of the coronary vein of our heart3 and
at the termination ofthe other large veinS, especially near the
beart, We not only find the orifices contradled , but doublings
at their edges, which have so far the effe& of valveS, even
⁷ in the dead body, that We cannot fill completely all the veius ἱ
by throwing an injezstion in at one of their branehes3 and bet-
ween the auricle and ventricle, valves are interpofed‚ 'which

perform their office with great accuracy,

With each other the coats of the different veffe18‚ through

which it paffeS.

30, When the large hrancbes of the branchia} arteriee
and veinS, or the branches os the antra, formed by the lat-
ter, were placed contiguous, they Were found to agree very
nearly in thickness, elassicety, and texture 3 nor could 1 perv⁸
